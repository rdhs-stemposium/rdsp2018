                <h3><b>STEMposium 2018</b></h3>
                <p>
                  Each year, River Dell’s Science Research Program presents the annual River Dell STEMposium. The STEMposium showcases the research of students in the Science Research course. Students work on their own individual research projects under the supervision of the course instructor and with guidance from a mentor. The STEMposium also features a keynote speaker to present the latest in science, engineering, technology, and mathematics. The seniors of the Science Research course also do an oral presentation to present their three years of research. By providing a medium to present these research projects, the STEMposium allows the River Dell community to interact with emerging sciences such as bioengineering, cybersecurity, and more.
                </p>
                <h3><b>Science Research</b></h3>
                <p>
                  The Science Research Class offered at River Dell High School allows students to conduct original research and compete in various science competitions. The course is offered through SUNY Albany's University in the High School program. Starting in their sophomore year, students explore various subject areas in the sciences that interest them, first by reading and evaluating general literature, then progressing to journals in scientific literature. Areas of study that may be investigated include mathematics, technology, physical sciences, life sciences, social sciences, psychology, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Science Research improves student's written and oral communication skills. During their research, students take notes and write responses to articles in their own lab notebooks. Students’ work is frequently reviewed to ensure progress on their projects. Students are also required to give presentations on their findings about twice a month. Other students give constructive criticism regarding improvements on their research as well as presentation skills. As a three-year commitment course, Students work on their research from their sophomore year through their senior year, including during the summer. The Science Research class allows students to engage with science in a way otherwise not possible.
                </p>

                      Headlines about cyber-attacks have become increasingly more common over the past decade. Although the investigation of vulnerabilities on hardware and operating systems is plentiful, fewer research projects have been conducted on the human-element of device security. Mobile devices are equipped with a myriad of security options that the user can choose to enable, but little data exists on whether users choose to enable those security features. For instance, iOS users have the option to enable “iCloud Activation Lock.” By doing so, security on the device is greatly enhanced, but it is up to the user to decide whether to enable the security measure. It is also possible that the user does not know that the security measure exists, in which case, our survey determines that level of awareness. Over the course of the 2017-18 school year, we have administered a survey to River Dell High School students that consists of questions concerning the security measures that they choose to enable on their personal device. Through our analysis of the collected data, we have already observed correlations between device security and grade level, course selection, and demographic. Following presentation at the STEMposium, we hope that our project will yield a greater understanding of teen awareness of cyber security and the measures that they take to secure their devices.

                      Over the last two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as the leading noninvasive method of examining the brain regions involved in complex neurological processes.  Several studies have examined sex differences in functional and behavioral responses to verbal and visual stimuli, but few have studied differences in response to musical stimuli. This study investigates sex differences in functional responses to emotional musical stimuli in both depressed and non-depressed participants. Data was obtained from a dataset published by Rebecca J. Lepping et. al on OpenfMRI, an open-access fMRI database. 19 participants (8 male, 11 female) diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and 20 never-depressed (ND) participants (9 male, 11 female) were subjected to 3 different stimuli: emotionally neutral "pure tones", positive and negative musical stimuli. Each participant underwent five sessions each consisting of a 31.5-second musical sample followed by 31.5 seconds of pure tones, separated by a three-second response period, repeated four times per session.  Data was analyzed using SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping).  Results indicate greater activation in healthy males in the primary auditory area (superior frontal gyrus) in response to both positive and negative music, while healthy females displayed greater activation of the thalamus and amygdala in response to negative music. Results also indicate greater activation in depressed males in the prefrontal cortex in response to positive music as well as greater activation in depressed males in the left pallidum in response to negative music.

                      Learning With the Kinect (LWK) is a project aimed at uncovering what learning style can benefit the most from a lesson structured around the Microsoft® Kinect. When approved, the experiment will take place at River Dell Middle School. Each student will use the LWK software to try to achieve the highest score possible. The LWK software has options for both English (Grammar) testing as well as Logic (Algebra) testing. Students will use their hands in kinesthetic motions, picked up by the Kinect sensor, to drag and drop answers on the screen. After the experiment has concluded, the data will be analyzed to see which type of learning style benefitted from the LWK program the most.

                      Bioprinting utilizes a 3D printer to create tissue-like and organ-like structures using bioinks, which are materials that mimic an extracellular matrix environment to support the adhesion and proliferation of living cells. More specifically, hydrogels are used, which are highly absorbent and flexible polymeric networks. To construct the biological structure of the nose, a viable density of chondrocyte cells isolated from the articular cartilage of one month old calves were cultured and seeded with an alginate hydrogel matrix to construct the bio-ink for 3D bioprinting. The printability of hydrogels are the focus of this research. The form of bioprinting used is inkjet-based bioprinting, since the bioink is not too viscous. Key benefits of inkjet bioprinting include high speed, availability, and relatively low costs. Disadvantages include lack of precision with regards to droplet size and droplet placement compared to other bioprinting methods. There is also a requirement for low viscosity bioink, which eliminates several effective bioinks from being used with this method. Frequent nozzle clogging and cellular distortion is also common. In order to overcome these obstacles, different methods of printing and cross-linking techniques are explored.

                      Microsatellites provide a new alternative to space research. Smaller than traditional satellites, they allow for reduced expenses and take less time to manufacture and deploy. Their chief downside is their decreased capacity, making it so that they are inacapable of carrying as much fuel as a normal satellite or as much equipment. To avert this, microsatellites utilize solar sails as energy sources. The nature of solar sails, and the need for rigidity cause microsatellites to carry excess weight. Our research thus focuses on integrating stiffness into the sails themselves to conserve space and allow for additional instruments to be implemented.

The objective of my research was to find the fuel that had the highest horsepower output and efficiency for a Honda CBR600RR engine. In this research study I gather information from  the Formula SAE Michigan results and literature review to choose a fuel that not only offers the best performance, but also offers consistency and ease of use.

Astronomers can use several different methods to detect these extra-solar planetary systems. Direct imaging, measuring the changes in luminosity as a planet passes over its parent star, radio and infrared waves are some of the few ways astronomers can detect such extra-solar planets. By observing and discovering exoplanets, we can begin to understand how commonly planetary systems form and continue our quest in the search for life, and learn more about our place in the universe and answer the age old question of whether or not we are truly alone.

                      Since its discovery, the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has led to remarkable discoveries in the field of neuroscience. It is an advanced and powerful way to measure brain activity, in ways not previously possible. Prior to the discovery of the fMRI, scientists studied the brain by removing and dissecting post mortem human brains of patients to compare to healthy brains. Scientists also use EEG (Electroencephalogram) to measure brain electrical activity through electrodes placed on the scalp. However, using the EEG, it is difficult to track where in the brain the signal is coming from.  Other techniques used to probe brain functions such as computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans use radiation. fMRI provides a better groundbreaking alternative.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      fMRI is a non-invasive and effective technique that can evaluate brain activity safely, without the use of radiation. It also produces high resolution images that are as detailed as 1 millimeter. The fMRI detects the location of brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow. This technique relies on the correlation between blood flow and neural activity; when a specific area of the brain is active during a task, blood flow to that region increases. This makes the fMRI a useful tool in answering questions about experimentally related activations. The high-quality anatomical images of the brain and visualization of activated regions allow for a wide scope of research and studies.

                      Many scientists have contributed to the Big Bang Theory over the years.  Georges Lemaître was the founder of this theory but he had no evidence at first and was met with much skepticism by other scientists.  Then Hubble's Law showed us the universe's expansion, and the discovery of Cosmic Microwave Background showed the radiation left by the Big Bang and provided observational evidence of the Big Bang.  This along with Einstein's Theory of Relativity and the Second Law of Thermodynamics has made the Big Bang Theory the widely accepted theory on the birth of the universe.  The further our understanding is towards the beginning of time and space, the better we can comprehend the current universe as well as make predictions on the universe in the future.

                      Empathy, the ability to understand the feelings of another, is a defining characteristic of humanity. Empathy is well-understood psychologically, but far less physiologically. This study investigated the correlation between empathy and neural activity by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). For this study, 22 participants (11 male, 11 female), each with a chosen familiar friend and an anonymous stranger, were attached to Ag-AgCl electrodes capable of delivering minor shocks (4 mA over 20 ms). Each group of participants underwent 5 sessions. During the first two sessions, shocks were administered to either the stranger or the friend, while during the final three sessions, shocks were administered the participant. Each session consisted of 2 shock cues (indicating a 100% chance of shock), 10 threat cues (indicating a 17% chance of shock), and 12 safety cues (indicating a 0% chance of shock). Data was analyzed using FMRIB’s Software Library (FSL). Results indicated significant activation in the anterior insula, putamen, and supramarginal gyrus—regions associated with the threat response—present in ‘threat to self’ conditions. This same neural activity was also present in ‘threat to friend’ conditions, but not in ‘threat to stranger’ conditions. These results suggest that empathy involves simulating the experiences of others, and that ability that strengthens with familiarity. These results also suggest that a defining component of social bonding is an increase in overlap between neural representations of self and other.

                      Telomeres are regions of repetitive DNA sequences located at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres act like a buffer and shorten when cells undergo mitosis. Telomerase is an enzyme that lengthens telomeres by adding telemeric repeats. Stem cells express low levels of telomerase, and somatic cells suppress telomerase after birth. Critically shortened telomeres likely increase the chances of health problems, such as organ failure, observed in old age. However, increasing the expression of telomerase in non-cancer resistant organisms increases the chance of cancer.

                      This study observes the effects of telomerase gene therapy on highly cancer-resistant mice. In mice, shortening or lengthening telomere length resulted, respectfully, in decreased or increased longevity. This study tested the effects of telomerase gene therapy on 1-year old and 2-year old mice. Mice were treated with an adeno associated virus (AAV) expressing mouse TERT, the gene for telomerase. Treated mice experienced exceptional benefits on health, including improved insulin sensitivity, improvement of several molecular biomarkers of aging, and decreases in osteoporosis incidents. Both treated 1-year old mice and treated 2-year old mice had an increase in median lifespan of 24% and 13%, respectively. In this case, treated mice did not develop more cancer than control mice. The results demonstrate that, in the case of cancer-resistant mice, telomerase treatment extends longevity and delay physiological aging without increasing cancer.

                      Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) is a gene that acts as a neuroprotective cytokine in response to injury of the central nervous system. A gene is haplodeficient if it is missing one diploid copy, or, in other words, is missing its copy. To have a LIF haplodeficiency would be to have half the amount of a gene's product, and thus a deficiency in the cell's function. The question asked by many scientists is this: is the LIF gene beneficial or detrimental in recovery after a closed head injury (CHI)? By comparing wild type (WT) mice given a CHI to LIF Haplodeficient mice given a CHI to WT mice not given a CHI and observing behavior when put through different behavioral tests several times post injury, it has been determined that a LIF haplodeficiency would result in slowed recovery and more severe, longer lasting behavioral deficits than a non-haplodeficient subject. I plan to study and further expand on this published research over the summer.
